- Which regions are the most affected by dengue, and how do they compare across years? 
- How should resources (e.g., hospital beds, medical supplies, awareness campaigns) be allocated regionally?
- How might the lack of recent data (post-2016) affect our understanding of current dengue trends?
- Does the decline in cases after 2012 reflect a real improvement or possible under-reporting?
- What additional data (e.g., rainfall, urban density, population demographics) would strengthen the analysis?
